# CRUD-blog-task

This is a simple web application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) blog posts. The stack used for the frontend is ReactJS, the backend is Node with ExpressJS and the database used is MongoDB.

To set up and run the application:

Do clone this repository and install node modules with the command npm i.
Start the server in the backend folder using the command npm start. This is because the api is currently locally hosted.
Ensure that your mongodb and mongodb compass is installed.
Do check if your mongodb is using ipv6, if not, do use the command mongod --ipv6 in the terminal of the C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server<version>\bin folder.
Then you can start the server in the frontend folder or simply use the link provided in the description of this github repository (where the application has been deployed) and use the blog application. Hope you enjoy using the application!
